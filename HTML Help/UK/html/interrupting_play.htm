  <p>You can interrupt play at any time during the game by clicking on your playing token in the players&#8217; area. The interrupt dialog box will appear, presenting you with a range of choices, from buying and selling buildings, to mortgaging and unmortgaging property, as well as proposing deals. Select which course of action you would like to take by clicking on the appropriate button.</p>

  <p>You will notice that the functions in the Interrupt dialog box are the same as those on the <a href="action_menu.htm">Action Menu.</a></p>
