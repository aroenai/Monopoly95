  <p>Q: Why can&#8217;t I install MONOPOLY CD-ROM onto my hard disk?</p>

  <p>A: One possibility is that you may be using a disk compression utility to squeeze more data onto your hard disk. These utilities may distort the actual space available for the installation of MONOPOLY CD-ROM. Try to free some additional disk space by deleting unnecessary files.</p>

  <p>Q: Why doesn&#39;t MONOPOLY CD-ROM load?</p>

  <p>A: You may need to update some of your Windows utilities with the versions provided on the MONOPOLY CD-ROM game disk. Reinstall the game, this time selecting WinG and Win32s for installation. If problems persist, reboot your computer and close any other applications that are running.</p>

  <p>Q: Why is it that when I play MONOPOLY CD-ROM over the Internet or on a network, the game sometimes pauses and/or my mouse pointer turns into an hourglass?</p>

  <p>A: Players on remote computers may have switched on the 3D animations, whilst you have not. Wait until they have finished viewing the animation before resuming the game.</p>

  <p>Q: Why doesn&#39;t MONOPOLY CD-ROM play digitized sound effects?</p>

  <p>A: First, go into the <u>O</u>ptions menu and look for the Digital <u>s</u>ound effects option. There should be a tick opposite this option. If there is none, click on the option to switch on sound effects. If you still cannot hear any digitized sound effects, verify that your current Windows installation supports digitized sounds. If not, try setting it up. The particular names of the files involved may be slightly different depending on your version of Windows, but the process is similar for all versions. Call up the Control Panel and double click on the Sound icon. This will enable you to test various Windows sound effects. If you are unable to select the sound effect files, it is likely that your Windows sound drivers are not installed, or have been installed incorrectly. Reinstall the sound drivers from your sound card installation disk. If the sound effects can be selected, but not heard, it could be that the volume is set too low, that there is no power to the speakers or a loose connection. If you are still unable to resolve the problem, contact our technical hotline at the number listed in the MONOPOLY CD-ROM manual.</p>

  <p>Q: Why doesn&#39;t MONOPOLY CD-ROM play MIDI music?</p>

  <p>A: First, go into the <u>O</u>ptions menu and look for the Background MIDI <u>m</u>usic option. There should be a tick opposite this option. If there is none, click on the option to switch on MIDI music. If you still cannot hear any music, verify that you have installed a MIDI driver for Windows. You will have done that when you installed your sound card drivers. You can look up the install information in the MIDI MAPPER utility in the Control Panel. To test your MIDI reproduction capability, call up Media Player, and select MIDI sequencer under the Device menu. Select the <b>canyon.mid</b> file to play. If you do not hear any sound, try reinstalling your Windows sound card drivers. If that doesn&#39;t help, check the loudspeaker volume, connections, and the loudspeakers&#39; power leads. If you are still unable to resolve the problem, please contact our technical support staff at the number listed in the MONOPOLY CD-ROM manual.</p>

  <p>Q: What should I do if all else fails?</p>

  <p>A: Try rebooting your computer. After entering Windows, make sure no other applications are running. If any are running, close them before starting MONOPOLY CD-ROM. Read through the MONOPOLY CD-ROM Late Notes file to see if there is any last minute information pertaining to your problem. As a last resort, call our technical hotline number, which is listed in the game manual. Refer to the Support section of the manual for on-line support services.</p>
