        <p>MONOPOLY CD-ROM is played according to the traditional rules of MONOPOLY. However, it is possible to alter certain aspects of the game by tweaking the Custom game rules. To change any of the default options, select Custom game rules. A dialog box appears. Simply click on any of the options that you wish to change. If you are playing MONOPOLY CD-ROM over the Internet or on a Network, all remote players get a chance to change or agree to any options you have selected. This process continues until all changes have been agreed upon. For more information on how to begin an Internet or Network game, see <a href="starting_a_game.htm">Starting a Game.</a></p>

        <p>MONOPOLY CD-ROM allows you to compete against players in other countries over the Internet. As the rules tend to differ slightly from country to country, the International options menu allows you to incorporate some of these different rules into your game. For example, under normal circumstances, only your standard Chance and Community Chest cards are used in a game. Click on one or more countries&#39; decks to add them to your game. Click on an already selected deck to remove it from your game. To choose any of the rule options, click on that rule. Click on an already selected rule to remove it from the list.</p>
