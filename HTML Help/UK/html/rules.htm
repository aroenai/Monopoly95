    <p>Charles B. Darrow, a heating engineer from Germantown, Pennsylvania, is credited with being the inventor of the game we now know as MONOPOLY. Being unemployed like millions of others during the Great Depression of the 1930s, Darrow recognised the potential of a game that would appeal to Americans with the thrill of dealing in big money and experiencing prosperity. His first games consisted of boards made out of oil cloth coloured with free paint samples from a local store. His houses and hotels were cut from beading picked up at a local timber yard and the title deeds made of old cardboard. The street names were those of real streets in Atlantic City &#8211; America&#39;s &quot;vacation city&quot; where, in previous, better times, Darrow would take his family for the summer. As for the playing tokens, it is believed that some of these were based on the charms of his wife&#39;s bracelet.</p>
    <p>Demand for the game soon grew beyond Darrow&#39;s family and friends and he was forced to contract out production of the board to a jobbing printer, enabling him to produce six sets a day. It was then that department stores began to order the game wholesale and he decided to expand production.</p>
    <p>In 1934 he approached Parker Brothers of Salem, Massachusetts, one of America&#39;s best-known games companies. However, the game was rejected on the grounds that it contained 52 fundamental errors: primarily it was too long, its rules were too complicated and there was no clear finish to the game.</p>
    <p>Returning to Pennsylvania, Darrow continued to produce the game, working 14 hours a day to produce 20,000 sets that year. This was enough to prove the success of the game to Parker Brothers who offered him an attractive royalty. Darrow accepted and the agreement was settled early in 1935. By mid-February of the same year, production was running at 20,000 sets per week and by the following year over 1,000,000 sets had been sold.</p>
    <p>Despite this initial success, Parker Brothers considered the MONOPOLY game an adult fad game &#8211; too complicated for children and destined to last just a few years. For this reason George Parker, the company&#39;s founder, ordered production of the game to cease &quot;against the possibility of a very early slump&quot;. The order was written just before the 1936 Christmas buying season. However, the figures for the season told a different story &#8211; they marked the start of the upward sales spiral.</p>
    <p>Since then, the MONOPOLY game has continued to attract people with its thrill to &quot;get rich quick&quot; despite the changing times from depression to prosperity. With 26 language versions now available in 43 countries, it remains the world&#39;s most popular board game ever produced. Each edition is based on a different country or city and each has its own currency. In 1935, Parker Brothers began to look around for manufacturers abroad and approached Waddingtons. The proposal received an enthusiastic response, but Victor Watson, the head of the company, decided that the game would have more appeal if the American place names were changed. He therefore sent his secretary, Marjory Phillips to take a walk round London &quot;to get the names right&quot;. Thus, the British version came to have London streets, the railroads became stations and the dollars became pounds &#8211; but the rules, of course, remained the same. Over the years, many other countries followed with their own national editions and even today in the 1990s the &quot;united nations&quot; of the Monopoly game is constantly gaining new members!</p>
    <p>Darrow himself was also successful. Having retired at the age of 46, he died, aged 78, the world&#39;s first ever millionaire games designer.</p>
    <p><b>THE GAME IN BRIEF</b></p>
    <p>MONOPOLY is the game of buying, renting or selling Properties so profitably that players increase their wealth &#8211; the wealthiest becoming the eventual winner.</p>
    <p>Starting from the &quot;GO&quot; space, move your token around the board according to your throw of the dice. When you land on a space that is not already owned by anyone else, you may buy it from the Bank. If you do not choose to buy it, it is auctioned off to the highest bidder. Players who own Properties collect rents from opponents stopping there. The construction of Houses and Hotels greatly increases the rent you can collect on Properties, so it is wise to build on as many Sites as possible. If you need to raise more money, the Bank can give mortgages on Building Sites. You must always obey the instructions given on Community Chest and Chance cards. Sometimes you will be sent to Jail.</p>

      <dd>
        <p>If you roll doubles, move your token and act on the space you have landed on as usual. Roll the dice again and have another turn. If you roll doubles for a third time in succession, you must immediately go straight to Jail.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Passing &quot;GO&quot;</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Every time you either land on or pass &quot;GO&quot; while moving in the direction of the arrow, you are paid &#163;200 by the Bank. It is possible to collect &#163;200 twice within one turn if, for example, you land on the Chance or Community Chest space immediately after &quot;GO&quot; and pick the card that tells you to &quot;Advance to GO&quot;.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Buying Property</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If you land on an unowned Property (that is, on a Building Site for which no other player holds the Title Deed), you have the first choice to buy it. If you decide to buy, pay the Bank the price in money stated on that space. You will receive in exchange, as proof of ownership, that Property&#39;s Title Deed, which you must keep face up in front of you. If you decide not to buy, the Banker must immediately auction the Property for sale to the highest bidder, starting at any price that another player is willing to pay. Even though you declined the option of buying at the original price, you may join in the bidding, too.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Owning Property</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Owning Property entitles you to collect rent from any &quot;tenants&quot; who land on that space. It is an advantage to own all the Properties within a colour group &#8212; in other words to own a monopoly. You can build on any Properties for which you own the complete colour group.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Landing on owned Property</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If you land on a Property that has previously been bought by another player, you may be required to pay rent for stopping there. The player who owns this Property must ask you for rent before the second player following you rolls the dice. The amount payable is shown on the Title Deed for that Property and will vary according to the number of buildings on it. If all Properties within a colour group are owned by a player, the rent payable is doubled on any Property of that group not yet built on. However, an owner who owns a whole colour-group may not collect double rent if any one site there is mortgaged. Where Houses or Hotels have been built on a Property, the rent will increase and will be shown on that Property&#39;s Title Deed. Rent is not payable on mortgaged Properties.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Landing on the utilities</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Landing on one of these allows you to buy the utility if it is not already owned. As with the other Property spaces, pay the Bank the price stated on that space. If the Property is already owned, you may be asked to pay rent to the owner according to the dice you rolled to get there. If the owner has only one of the utilities, the rent will be four times your dice roll. If, however, both utilities are owned by the same player, you must pay ten times the amount of your dice roll. If you are sent here as a result of a Chance or Community Chest card, you must roll the dice to determine how much you should pay.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Landing on the stations</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If you are the first to land here, you have the opportunity to buy the station. Otherwise it is auctioned by the Bank; even though you declined to buy at the original price, you may join the bidding, too. If the station is already owned when you arrive, you must pay the amount stated on the Title Deed. The amount payable will vary according to the number of other stations owned by that player.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Landing on &quot;Chance&quot; and &quot;Community Chest&quot;</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Landing on one of these spaces means you must take the relevant card from the top of the deck. These cards may ask you to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>move your token</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>pay money &#8211; for example, in taxes</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>receive money</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>get out of Jail free.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You must follow the instructions on the card and act immediately before returning the card to the bottom of the deck. If you pick a &quot;Get Out of Jail Free&quot; card, you may keep it until you wish to use it or sell it at a mutually agreed price.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> a card may instruct you to move your token to another space. If you pass &quot;GO&quot; on the way, collect &#163;200. You do <i>not</i> pass &quot;GO&quot; when you are sent to Jail.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Landing on Tax spaces</b></dt>

        <p>If you land on this space, you simply rest here until your next turn. There is no penalty for landing here: you may still continue dealing as usual (for example, collect rent, build on Properties you own, etc.).</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Jail</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>You will be sent to Jail if:</p>

          <li>
            <p>you land on the &quot;GO TO JAIL&quot; space, <i>or</i></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>you pick a Chance or Community Chest card which tells you to &quot;GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL&quot;, <i>or</i></p>

        <p>Your turn ends when you are sent to Jail. If you are sent there, you may not collect a &#163;200 salary, regardless of where you are on the board.</p>
        <p>To get out of Jail you may:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>pay a fine of &#163;50 and continue on your next turn, <i>or</i></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>purchase a &quot;Get Out Of Jail Free&quot; card from another player at a mutually agreed price and use this to get out, <i>or</i></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>use a &quot;Get Out Of Jail Free&quot; card if you have one, <i>or</i></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>wait there for three turns, rolling the dice on each turn to try to roll doubles. If you roll doubles on any turn, move out of Jail using this dice roll.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>After you have waited three turns, you must move out of Jail and pay &#163;50 before moving your token according to your dice roll.</p>
        <p>While in Jail you can collect rent on Properties provided they are not mortgaged.</p>
        <p>If you are not &quot;sent to Jail&quot; but, during the course of play, land on the Jail space, you are &quot;Just Visiting&quot; and incur no penalty. On your next turn, you move ahead as usual.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><a id=houses></a><b>Houses</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Once you own all Properties of a colour group, you can buy Houses to put on any of those spaces. This increases the rent you may charge to passing tenants. The price of a House is shown on the relevant Title Deed. You can buy on your turn or in between other players&#39; turns but you must build evenly: you cannot build a second House on any one Site of a colour group until you have built one House on <i>every</i> Site of that group, and so on up to a maximum of four Houses per Property. Selling Houses must be done evenly, too. You may buy or sell at any time, and as many buildings as your judgement and financial standing will allow.</p>
        <p>Houses may not be built if <i>any</i> Site of the same colour group is mortgaged.</p>
        <p>If you own all Properties of a colour group and only one or two of them have been built on, you can still collect double rent from another player who lands on one of your unimproved Properties in that colour group.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Hotels</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>You must have four Houses on <i>each</i> Site of a complete colour group before you can buy a Hotel. Hotels are bought in the same way as Houses and cost four Houses, which are returned to the Bank, plus the price as shown on the Title Deed.</p>
        <p>Only one Hotel may be erected on any one Site.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Building shortages</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If there are no Houses left in the Bank, you must wait for other players to return theirs before you can buy any. Similarly, when selling Hotels you cannot replace them with Houses if there are none left.</p>
        <p>If a limited number of Houses or Hotels is left and two or more players wish to buy more than the Bank has, the Banker auctions them off to the highest bidder, starting at the lowest price shown on the relevant Title Deed(s).</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Selling Property</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>You may sell undeveloped Sites, Railway Stations and Utilities to any other player as a private deal for a sum agreeable to both of you. No Site, however, may be sold to another player if any buildings stand on any of the Sites of that colour group. Should you wish to sell a Site from a colour group, you must first sell all buildings on those Sites to the Bank.</p>
        <p>Houses must be sold evenly, in the same way as they were bought <i>(see &quot;<a href="#houses">Houses</a>&quot; above)</i>.</p>
        <p>Houses and Hotels cannot be sold to other players. They must be sold to the Bank <i>at half the value</i> stated on the relevant Title Deed. They may be sold at any time.</p>
        <p>For Hotels, the Bank will pay half the cash price of the Hotel plus half the price of the four Houses which were given to the Bank for the purchase of the Hotel. All Hotels on one colour-group may be sold at once.</p>
        <p>If necessary, Hotels can be broken back down into Houses to raise money. To do this, you can sell a Hotel to the Bank and receive in exchange four Houses as well as money for the Hotel (i.e. half its cost).</p>
        <p>Mortgaged Property cannot be sold to the Bank, but to other players only.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Mortgages</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If you have no money left and are required to pay a debt, you can raise money by mortgaging a Property. To do this, first sell off any buildings on that Property to the Bank. To mortgage a Property, turn its Title Deed face down and collect from the Bank your mortgage to the value of the amount shown on the back of the card. When you wish to repay your mortgage you must pay this amount plus 10% interest.</p>
        <p>If you mortgage a Property, you retain possession of it. No other player can secure it by paying off the mortgage to the Bank.</p>
        <p>Rent cannot be collected on a mortgaged Property although it can still be collected for other Properties of that colour group.</p>
        <p>You <i>can</i> sell mortgaged Property to other players at any agreed price. The buyer can then decide to remove the mortgage immediately by paying off the mortgage plus the 10% interest. Alternatively, he can pay the 10% but retain the Property with a mortgage. In this case, when the mortgage is finally removed an additional 10% is payable.</p>
        <p>When all Sites of a colour-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy back Houses at full price.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Bankruptcy</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If you owe the Bank or another player more money than you can raise from your assets, you are declared bankrupt and are out of the game.</p>
        <p>If your debt is to the Bank, the Bank gains all your cash and Title Deeds. The Banker then auctions off each Property to the highest bidder.</p>
        <p>You must return &quot;Get Out Of Jail Free&quot; cards to the bottom of the relevant pile.</p>
        <p>If you are made bankrupt by another player, your Houses and Hotels are sold to the Bank at half their original cost and that player receives any cash, Title Deeds and &quot;Get Out Of Jail Free&quot; cards you own. If you own any mortgaged Property, you must also turn this over to that player; he must immediately pay 10% and then choose whether to retain the mortgage or pay it off in full now.</p>

      <dt><b>Notes on play</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If you owe more rent than you can pay in cash, you may pay your creditor part in cash and part in Property (i.e. empty Building Sites). In this case, the creditor may choose to accept certain Property (even if it is mortgaged) at a value far in excess of the printed one in order to obtain additional Building Sites or to block another player from obtaining control of that Property.</p>
        <p>If you own Property, it is up to you to watch out for rents to be collected.</p>
        <p>Money can only be loaned to a player by the Bank and then only by mortgaging property.</p>
        <p>No player may borrow money from or lend money to another player.</p>

    <h2>RULES FOR A SHORT GAME</h2>
    </p>
    <p>There are three differences in rules for this &quot;Short Game.&quot;</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>During <b>PREPARATION</b> for play the banker shuffles the deck of Title Deed cards. The player to the left of the banker then cuts the deck and the Banker deals, one at a time, two Title Deeds to each player (including himself if he both plays and acts as Banker). Players receiving Title Deeds must immediately pay the Bank the printed price of each of the two properties thus acquired. Play then starts as in the standard game.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In this short game you need build only three Houses (instead of four) on each Site of a complete colour group before buying a Hotel.</p>
        <p>Rent received for a Hotel remains the same as in the standard game.</p>
        <p>When selling Hotels, the value is still one-half the purchase price, which in this game is one house less than in the regular game.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>END OF GAME</b>. The first player to go bankrupt retires from the game as in the standard game. However, as soon as a second player goes bankrupt, the game ends. The bankrupt player turns over to his creditor (either the Bank or another player) all that he has of value, including buildings and any other properties.</p>
        <p>Each remaining player then values his property:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>cash in hand;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Sites, utilities and stations owned by him at the price printed on the board;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>any mortgaged property owned by him at one-half of the price printed on the board;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Houses, valued at purchase price;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Hotels, valued at the purchase price including the value of the three Houses exchanged.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The richest player wins!</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    <h2>TIME LIMIT GAME</h2>
    </p>
    <p>Here&#39;s another short game you can try. Before starting, agree upon a definite time to finish the game, with the richest player at this time winning. Before starting the game, Title Deed cards are shuffled and cut, and the Banker deals two to each player. Players immediately pay the Bank the price of property dealt to them and play continues as with the standard game.</p>
    <p>
    <h2>Questions that people ask about MONOPOLY Rules</h2>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><b>Do I have to go around the board once before purchasing property?</b></p>
        <p>No. You may begin purchasing property with the first available space you land on.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Can I collect rent while in Jail?</b></p>
        <p>Yes. You can collect rent and conduct business as usual while in Jail.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Do I get any money for landing on Free Parking?</b></p>
        <p>No. If you land on Free Parking, you receive no money, property or reward of any kind.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>If I own all the properties of one colour-group, can I put three houses on only one property?</b></p>
        <p>No. You must build evenly at all times. For example, you cannot put two houses on any property of a colour group until each property of that group has one house on it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Do I have to wait until my turn to buy houses and hotels?</b></p>
        <p>No. You can transact business &#8211; such as buying and selling houses &#8211; at any time on your turn or between moves by other players.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Can I mortgage a property to buy other properties, houses or hotels?</b></p>
        <p>Yes. You can mortgage property to buy houses, hotels or other properties of any colour group.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Common points relating to mortgaging:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>You need not own all properties of a colour group in order to mortgage one of those properties. Property may not be mortgaged, however, if there are buildings on that colour group. Buildings must be sold back to the Bank at half their original price before you can mortgage the property in question.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Double rent cannot be collected from a colour-group if any site there is mortgaged.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If you own all four stations and mortgage one or more of them, you can collect rent only from the unmortgaged station(s).</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Don&#39;t forget:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Whenever a card directs you to advance to any space, move FORWARDS, NOT BACKWARDS.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When assessed for street repairs, pay for all houses and hotels you own on the entire board at that time.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When a Chance or Community Chest card sends you to another property, collect &#163;200 if you pass &quot;GO&quot; on the way.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Are deals allowed between players?</b></p>
        <p>Yes. Empty (i.e. unimproved) Building Sites, stations, and utilities (but not buildings) can be sold to any player as a private deal for any amount that the owner can get.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Can I borrow money from another player?</b></p>
        <p>No. You can borrow money only from the Bank.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Why does my set have only 32 houses?</b></p>
        <p>To maintain a balance in the game. There have always been exactly 32 houses and 12 hotels in the game of MONOPOLY. If it were possible to improve all properties, it would be difficult to force opponents into bankruptcy.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>What happens in the event of a building shortage?</b></p>
        <p>In the event of a building shortage where two or more players are waiting to buy houses and hotels, the Bank can auction the buildings to the highest bidder as they become available.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Can I make my own rules?</b></p>
        <p>Some people play MONOPOLY according to what are called &quot;house rules&quot;. A common example is placing Tax money on Free Parking and allowing any player who lands there to collect all the money he finds there at that moment. The official rules &#8211; which are followed in tournament play &#8211; do not permit such variations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>What if the Bank runs out of money?</b></p>
        <p>Some players think the Bank is bankrupt if it runs out of money. The Bank never goes bankrupt. To continue playing, use slips of paper to keep track of each player&#39;s banking transactions &#8211; until the Bank has enough paper money to operate again.</p>
