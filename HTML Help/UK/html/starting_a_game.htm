  <h2><a name="starting_a_game" id="starting_a_game"></a>Starting a Game</h2>

  <p>Starting MONOPOLY CD-ROM is very easy, whether you&#39;re playing on a stand-alone computer, or over the Internet. When you begin a new game, a series of buttons appear to the left of the board. The Add player #1 button is highlighted. Clicking on this button causes a dialog box to appear that enables you to add a player to your game. Select the type of player you wish to add (a real person, a computer-simulated player, or a player on the Internet or on a Network), a name for that player, and a playing token for that player to use. You may continue to add players to the game by clicking on the next available Add player button. If you wish to include someone who is on the Internet or Network, you will have to provide their correct address.</p>

  <p>MONOPOLY CD-ROM can be played by several people on one computer, or on several computers over a Network or the Internet. If you play over the Internet or a Network, one player&#39;s computer acts as the host, and all the others are remote players. A host will wait for remote players to connect to its game. A remote player connects to a host by clicking on the Player on Internet / Network button of the Add player dialog box. When you click on this button, you will be asked to call a host. You must then provide the host&#39;s IP address.</p>

  <p>Upon connecting to a host, your game will take on all the Custom game rules and international rules settings of the host. Once the game has started, you can try to change certain options, but all other players must agree before this is accepted.</p>

  <p><u>IP address</u></p>

  <p>An IP address is a unique code that identifies and locates a remote player&#8217;s computer on the Internet. If you join an Internet service or use full SLIP/PPP access through an on-line service, your computer will be given an IP address. Please consult your service provider or information service on how to obtain your IP address. In some cases, your IP address might change every time you use the Internet. If so, you will have to determine your current address each time you connect.</p>
