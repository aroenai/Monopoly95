  <h2><a name="proposing_a_deal" id="proposing_a_deal"></a>Proposing a Deal</h2>

  <p>You may propose a deal from two locations: the Action menu and the Interrupt dialog box. Any player may initiate a proposal. When you select Propose a Deal, the centre of the board turns into a dealing floor. All active playing tokens are shown. The player proposing the transaction can now begin to outline his or her proposal. Remote players on another computer will not see the proposed deal until it is complete.</p>

  <p>To put a deal together, the player who initiates the deal must specify which items he wishes to offer or get from each other player as part of the deal. By moving another token&#39;s property into his trading window, the player proposing the deal is indicating that he would like to acquire that item. By placing something in another token&#39;s trading window, the proposing player indicates that he would like to offer that item. The proposing player may involve as many other players in the deal as he desires. Once the proposal is complete, other players can assess the merits of the deal. Players who are involved in the proposed deal may either accept or reject it. They can also launch a counter offer. Players who are not involved in the proposed deal can only make <i>counter offers</i>.</p>

  <p>During a deal, property ownership is displayed on the board. To include a title deed as part of a deal, move the mouse pointer over the property you wish to offer and click. Notice how the pointer changes in appearance. Now move the pointer over to the trading window of the token to whom you wish to offer the title deed and click. The deed is then placed in that token&#39;s trading window.</p>

  <p>To include money as part of the deal, click on the money icon of the playing token whom you want to put up the money. Notice how the pointer changes in appearance. Move the pointer over to the trading window of the token you want to receive the money and click. A dialog box will appear, into which you should type the amount of money to be put up. That amount will appear in that token&#39;s trading window.</p>

  <p>To include a Get Out of Jail Free card as part of the deal, click on the card icon of the token whom you want to offer the card. Notice how the pointer changes in appearance. Move the pointer over to the trading window of the token you want to receive the card and click. The Get Out of Jail Free card will appear in that token&#39;s trading window.</p>

  <p>You may include immunity as part of a deal, if this option was selected in the Custom game rules. Immunity is a facility whereby you grant another player free passage over one of your properties as part of a deal. To include immunity as part of the deal, click on the &quot;winged title deed&quot; icon of the token whom you want to offer the immunity. Notice how the pointer changes in appearance. Move the pointer over the board onto the property for which you would like to grant immunity, and click. Notice how the pointer changes in appearance. Move the pointer over to the trading window of the token you want to receive immunity and click again. A dialog box will appear, into which you should type in the number of landings for which the immunity is to be valid (anything between 1 and 99). The immunity offer will appear in the receiving token&#39;s trading window. A player may offer himself immunity on a property that he owns, if he has already offered the title deed to another player as part of his deal proposal.</p>
