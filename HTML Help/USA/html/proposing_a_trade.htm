  <h2><a name="proposing_a_trade" id="proposing_a_trade"></a>Proposing a Trade</h2>

  <p>Proposing a trade may be initiated from two places: the Action menu and the Interrupt dialog box. Any player may initiate a trade. After selecting Propose a Trade, the inside area of the game board becomes a trading window. All player tokens are shown. The player proposing a trade may now begin to build the specifics of the trade. Players on another computer will not see the trade construction until the proposal is complete.</p>

  <p>To build a trade, the player proposing the trade must specify which items each token would receive as part of the potential deal. By placing another token&#39;s item in his trading window, the player proposing the trade is indicating that he would like to receive that item. By placing an item in another token&#39;s trading window, the proposing player indicates that he would like to offer that item. The proposing player may involve as many other players in the trade as he wishes. After the trade is built, other players will have a chance to react to the offer. Players who are involved in the proposed trade will have a chance to accept or reject the trade. They may also counter, offering a different trade for consideration. Players not involved in the proposed trade can <i>counter</i> only.</p>

  <p>In the trading screen, property ownership is displayed on the game board. To offer a title deed as part of a trade, move the mouse pointer over the property to be offered and click. Notice the cursor change. Now move the new cursor over the trading window of the token meant to receive the title deed and click. The deed is then placed in that token&#39;s trading window.</p>

  <p>To offer cash as part of the trade, click on the cash icon of the token meant to offer the cash. Notice the cursor change. Move the new cursor over the trading window of the token meant to receive the cash and click. A dialog box will appear, and you must type in the amount of money to be offered. The amount of the offer will appear in that token&#39;s trading window.</p>

  <p>To offer a Get Out of Jail Free card as part of the trade, click on the card icon of the token meant to offer the card. Notice the cursor change. Move the new cursor over the trading window of the token meant to receive the card and click. The Get Out of Jail Free card will appear in that token&#39;s trading window.</p>

  <p>Immunity may be offered as part of a trade, if this option was selected from the Custom game rules. Immunity is the ability to grant another token free passage on one of your properties as part of a trade. To offer immunity as part of the trade, click on the &quot;winged title deed&quot; icon of the token meant to offer the immunity. Notice the cursor change. Move the new cursor over the property on the game board for which you would like to grant immunity. Notice the cursor change. Move the new cursor over the trading window of the token meant to receive immunity and click. A dialog box will appear, and you must type in the number of immunities to grant. The number can be between 1 and 99. The immunity offer will appear in that token&#39;s trading window. A player may offer himself immunity on a property that he owns, so long as that title deed has already been offered to another player as part of this trade.</p>
