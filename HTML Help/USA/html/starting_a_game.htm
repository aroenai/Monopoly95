  <p>Starting the MONOPOLY CD-ROM game is very simple, whether you&#39;re playing on one computer, or across the Internet. When you begin a new game, a series of buttons appears to the left of the game board. The Add player #1 button is highlighted. By clicking on this button, a dialog box appears that allows you to add a player at your computer. Select the kind of player you wish to add, a name for that player, and a token that player will use. You may continue to add players to the game by clicking on the appropriate Add player button. If you add a friend on the Internet / Network, you will also have to provide the correct connectivity information.</p>

  <p>The MONOPOLY CD-ROM game can be played by several people on one computer, or on several computers across a Network or the Internet. If you play across the Internet or a Network, one player&#39;s computer is the host, and all others are remote players. A host will wait for remote players to connect to his game. A remote player connects to a host by clicking on the Friend on Internet / Network button of the Add player dialog box. When you click on this button, you&#39;ll be asked to call a host. After that, you must provide the host&#39;s IP address.</p>

  <p>Upon connecting to a host, your game will take on the all Custom game rules and international rules settings of the host. Once the game has started, if you attempt a options change, all other players must agree before it can be accepted.</p>

  <p>An IP address is a unique number on the Internet that identifies your friend&#39;s computer. When you subscribe to an Internet service or use full SLIP/PPP access through an on-line service, your computer will be given an IP address. Please refer to your service provider or information service on how to retrieve your IP address. In some cases, your IP address will change each time you use the Internet. In such cases, you will have to determine it each time you connect.</p>
