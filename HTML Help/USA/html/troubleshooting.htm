  <p>Q: Why doesn&#39;t MONOPOLY CD-ROM game install onto my hard drive?</p>

  <p>A: One reason is that you may be using a disk compression utility to squeeze more data onto your hard drive. These utilities may distort the actual space available for the installation of the MONOPOLY CD-ROM game. Try to free some additional disk space by deleting unneeded files.</p>

  <p>Q: Why doesn&#39;t MONOPOLY CD-ROM game load?</p>

  <p>A: You may need to update your Windows software with the version provided on the MONOPOLY CD-ROM game disk. Reinstall the game, this time selecting WinG and Win32s for installation. If problems persist, restart your computer and close any other applications that are running.</p>

  <p>Q: When playing the MONOPOLY CD-ROM game across the Internet or on a network, why does the game sometimes pause and/or make my mouse an hourglass?</p>

  <p>A: Players on remote computers may have the 3D movies turned on, while you have them turned off. You have to wait until they have finished viewing the movie before the game can continue.</p>

  <p>Q: Why doesn&#39;t MONOPOLY CD-ROM game play digitized sound effects?</p>

  <p>A: First, look under the <u>O</u>ptions menu at the Digital <u>s</u>ound effects setting. Make sure a check mark appears next to this option. If a check mark does not appear, click on this option to turn on sound effects. If you are still not hearing digitized sound effects, verify that digitized sounds work under your normal Windows installation. The specific names of the utilities may be slightly different depending on your version of Windows, but the process is similar for all versions. Under the Control Panel, double click on the Sound utility. Here you should be able to test various Windows sound effects. If the sound effect files are not selectable, this usually means that your Windows sound drivers are not installed, or have been installed incorrectly. Reinstall the sound drivers from your sound card installation disk. If the sound effects can be tested, but not heard, the problem is usually low volume, no power to speakers or a loose connection. If you are still unable to resolve the problem, please contact our technical support staff at the number listed.</p>

  <p>Q: Why doesn&#39;t MONOPOLY CD-ROM game play MIDI music?</p>

  <p>A: First, look under the <u>O</u>ptions menu at the Background MIDI <u>m</u>usic setting. Make sure a check mark appears next to this option. If a check mark does not appear, click on this option to turn on MIDI music. If you are still not hearing music, verify that you have installed a MIDI driver for Windows. This should have happened when you installed your sound card drivers. You can review the install information in the MIDI MAPPER utility under the Control Panel. To test your MIDI reproduction capability, use Media Player, and select MIDI sequencer under the Device menu. Select the <b>canyon.mid</b> file to play. If you do not hear music, try reinstalling your Windows sound card drivers. If that doesn&#39;t help, check speaker volume, connections, and power to the speakers. If you are still unable to resolve the problem, please contact our technical support staff at the number listed.</p>

  <p>Q: What can I try if all else fails?</p>

  <p>A: Try restarting your computer. After starting Windows, make sure no other applications are running. If any are running, close them before starting the MONOPOLY CD-ROM game. Take a look at the MONOPOLY CD-ROM Game Late Notes file to see if any last minute information pertains to your situation. Finally, call our technical support staff at 714-833-1999. You may also review the Support section of the MONOPOLY CD-ROM game manual for on-line support services.</p>
